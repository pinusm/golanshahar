# About

I am Golan Shahar, a clinical-health and developmental-health psychologist and a translational stress/health researcher. I serves as Professor of Psychology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, visiting Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine, and an affiliated faculty member of the Edward Ziegler Center in Child Development and Social Policy. 

I treat and research stress, psychopathology, psychosomatic conditions, and resilience, with a focus on adolescence and early adulthood.
My research was funded by competetive research grants in Israel and the United States, and was published in the most prestigious journals in psychology, psychiatry, and pediatrics.

In 2015 I published a book with Oxford University Press, where I proposesd a novel theory of self-criticism and criticism-based relationships. I am currently working on a second book, dealing with complex and resistant depression.

Alongside my clinical and academic work, I frequently give consultations and presentations to health and private institutes, about mental and phisycal health, stress, burnout, and mental resilience.
